### Kvas

bread 4 * 500 g on 50 L

    why this much bread?
    to achieve plotnost 4 briks

4 kg solod  

    sugar - can replace solod
    Assuming a 75% sugar content in the malt (a rough average), you would have approximately 3 kg of sugar in 4 kg of malt.
    The efficiency of the extraction process, including mashing and lautering, can vary from one brewing system to another. 
    It can range from 70% to 85% or more. If you have an extraction efficiency of, say, 80%, 
    you would extract about **2.4 kg of sugar** (80% of the 3 kg) from your **4 kg of malt**.

Then, on 35 liters:

2.8 buhanok hleb
2.8 kg solod - 1.68 kg sugar 

Buying both allrounder and zilla makes sense.
We can start with allrounder for a reason of it being simple.
Because all rounder can be used as a keg, even if I will use only zilla for fermenting.
With pressure transfer it's perfect, or can even be used for secondary fermentation.
And because I'm not sure which one will I like better ultimately.
And it's better than the keg IMO, because you can see what's inside, and also it 
will just fit nicely inside the cooling system.
And it's not that much more expensive.
The goal here is natural carbonation and pressure control.

For kvass then I don't need a special kettle, I will probably just do the way 
I did it before - just nastoi in a pot.
I also don't need a chiller because it's cold outside anyway.

Both zilla and allrounder are rated T to 122°F, so technically speaking you can 
just pour boiling wort inside. For kvas, that would be with together with bread zakvaska.
With that done, the original wort will be sterile by definition.
Then, once it cools, we can use pressurized dry hopping technique to introduce yeast, 
which should minimize the contamination.
After primary fermentation for a couple of days, we can do pressurized transfer
into a "keg", to get rid of bread zakvaska and other dust, and leave it 
in a cool place to get consumed and age.

Ideally - Use HopBong ($179)
https://www.morebeer.com/products/hop-bong-pressure-pack-fermzilla-2.html
Video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5ylQoUCrBw

With the above technique and Hop Bong, it actually makes sense to start in 
allrounder and then move it to zilla, because removing all the bread using 
lower valve in zilla is impractical.
We want to move the cleaner wort to zilla, leaving all the zakvaska in allrounder,
and then let the sediment fall in zilla, also aiding the process by cold crashing it.
then that sediment is more convenient to remove using lower valve, after which process
it can be consumed from zilla, or optionally transferred back to allrounder, which
is by all means a better keg than zilla.
On top of that allrounder can hold 3 more liters, so that's the difference
in zakvaska.

Without a Hop Bong, we'll have to use zilla's lower valve for more traditional 
dry ~~hopping~~ (dry yeasting in our case).
That means we need to start in zilla, and then transfer to allrounder.
In this scenario it makes less sense to transfer it back to zilla, 
even for the sake of reducing the sediment.
Instead we can just leave it in allrounder and consume from there, 
since it's a great keg.

In a setup with one fermenter, we need to buy zilla first, because otherwise
we won't be able to do sanitary dry yeasting.
In this case adding zakvaska to fermenter is not reasonable, it will create 
too much sediment.
We need to keep it just like drobina in a bag.
Maybe we can boil it twice or something, but we need then to introduce wort only 
to fermenter, without zakvaska.

Additional requirement for 2 ferm setup is a Pressure transfer kit:

FERMENTATION TEMPERATURE CONTROL, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFoQObUQzyc
he's saying with pressure you will be able to ferment at 75-80 F, (24-27 C) 
what you'd normally ferment at 50 F (10 C).

BUT
S. cerevisiae was the yeast best adapted to grow at high temperatures within the 
Saccharomyces genus, with the highest optimum (32.3°C) and maximum (45.4°C) growth 
temperatures.
The optimum growth temperature for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly used in 
brewing and baking, typically lies within a much lower temperature range, 
around 25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F).
At a temperature of approximately 5°C (41°F), Saccharomyces cerevisiae becomes dormant.

SAF-SPECIFIC:
Saf Gold:
Maintain dough temperature at 78°F (26°C)
Saf Red:
proof at room temperature

Pressure will prevent yeast from producing fusel alcohol and other off flavors 
associated with fermenting at high temperatures.
Also, it will mute pretty much all of your yeast expression.
Good for lagers, but not for ales.
It benefits new england IPAs, because it also traps a lot of aromatics.
- kweik yeast - hot fermentation, up to 100
- english yeasts cold fermentation (62-65)
- kolsch/german ale strains (high 50s/low 60s)

GPT:
If you're using dry yeast, a common guideline is to use approximately 0.5 to 1 gram of yeast per gallon of wort or must.

Let it sit in a keg, Lager at 34 F.

Set spunding valve to 5 PSI and gradually move to 15 over the course of
fermentation. That will allow us to have some yeast character.
5 PSI - for a week
He's saying ferment 3-7 days with 5 PSI at 68-75 F (20-24 C).
Then transfer to a keg.
To speed up clarifying - add gelatin and/or cold crash. that drops out yeast 
out of the solution, sometimes protein.

Even with 5 psi the yeast was too suppressed and for that reason esters weren't
produced in sufficient quantites and beer lacked character.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxpswhNvQIY&t=12s
This guys fermented at 15 psi.
for 6 days, to ensure complete fermentation.
Then transferred to a keg. after a day added gelatin.
3 days "lagering" (1 day cold crash + 2 days gelatin)
carbonating (forced CO2) - 3 days, it was already carbonated naturally.
11th day - drinking.

Stabilization:
Potassium Sorbate - stabilizer
Potassium Metabisulfate - preservative
Can use both.

ALTERNATIVE:
    - pasteurization to kill yeast (will affect flavor)
    - cold crashing to kill yeast (hard, can come back to life)

Preservatives: Preservatives are added to beverages to inhibit the growth of 
microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, and molds. They help prevent spoilage 
and maintain the safety of the product. However, preservatives do not necessarily
prevent all types of aging or changes in flavor, color, or texture that can occur 
in beverages over time.

Stabilizers: Stabilizers are used to maintain or improve the physical and 
chemical properties of a beverage, such as texture, consistency, and appearance. 
While stabilizers can help prevent certain types of degradation, they do not 
provide the same level of protection against microbial spoilage as preservatives.

It's generally a good practice to add stabilizers or preservatives
only after you are satisfied with the way your beer tastes and you're ready to 
prevent further fermentation or carbonation. Adding a stabilizer prematurely could 
prevent your beer from undergoing the desired flavor maturation and other aging 
processes.

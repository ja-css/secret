## What's attenuation in regard to brewing yesat
ChatGPT
In brewing, attenuation refers to the percentage of sugars that yeast consumes and converts into alcohol and carbon dioxide during fermentation. It is a critical concept in the brewing process and is often used to describe the yeast's ability to ferment sugars.

The attenuation of a yeast strain is typically expressed as a percentage and can help brewers understand how completely the yeast has fermented the available sugars in the wort. There are two primary types of attenuation:

Apparent Attenuation: This is a measurement of the yeast's ability to ferment both fermentable and unfermentable sugars in the wort. It is calculated using the initial (original) and final gravity readings of the beer. The formula for apparent attenuation is as follows:

Apparent Attenuation (%) = [(Original Gravity - Final Gravity) / (Original Gravity - 1)] x 100

Apparent attenuation gives you an overall view of the yeast's fermentation performance, but it may not account for the types of sugars consumed.

Real Attenuation: Real attenuation measures the yeast's ability to ferment only the fermentable sugars in the wort. It does not take into account the unfermentable sugars, such as those from specialty malts or non-fermentable sugars like lactose. The formula for real attenuation is:

Real Attenuation (%) = [(Real Extract - Apparent Extract) / Real Extract] x 100

Real attenuation provides a more accurate picture of the yeast's performance regarding the primary sugars that contribute to alcohol content and the beer's overall character.

Understanding the attenuation characteristics of a specific yeast strain is essential for brewers because it can influence the final flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel of the beer. Yeast strains vary in their attenuation capabilities, with some being highly attenuative (fermenting most of the available sugars) and others being less attenuative (leaving more residual sweetness).

The brewer's choice of yeast strain and its attenuation properties plays a crucial role in achieving the desired beer style and flavor profile. High-attenuating yeast strains are typically used for creating drier beers with higher alcohol content, while low-attenuating yeast strains are used for sweeter, fuller-bodied beer styles.

## What's `phenolic` and `estery` in regard to brewing yeast
ChatGPT
In brewing, both phenolic and estery characteristics are related to the flavor and aroma compounds produced by yeast during fermentation. These compounds can significantly influence the overall flavor and aroma profile of the finished beer. Let's look at each of these terms in more detail:

1. Phenolic Compounds:

Phenolic compounds are a group of organic chemicals that can impart a range of flavors and aromas to beer.
In brewing, phenolic characteristics are often described as having a medicinal, smoky, or spicy quality.
Phenols are produced by yeast during fermentation, but they can also be introduced through ingredients or as a result of the brewing process (e.g., using certain grains or exposing the beer to chlorine).
Phenolic off-flavors are generally considered undesirable in many beer styles but are intentionally sought after in some beer styles, such as Belgian Saisons, which may have a subtle spiciness.
2. Esters:

Esters are a group of organic compounds that contribute fruity and floral aromas to beer.
During fermentation, yeast produces esters through the interaction of alcohol and organic acids.
The type and intensity of estery aromas can vary depending on the yeast strain, fermentation temperature, and other factors.
Common ester aromas include fruity notes like banana, apple, pear, and various citrus fruits.
The balance between phenolic and estery characteristics in beer is critical in achieving the desired flavor profile for a specific style. Here are some key points related to these characteristics:

Yeast Strain: Different yeast strains produce varying levels of both phenolic and estery compounds. Brewers select yeast strains based on the desired flavor and aroma characteristics for the beer style they're brewing.

Fermentation Temperature: Fermentation temperature plays a significant role in controlling the production of esters and phenols. Higher temperatures often lead to increased ester production, while lower temperatures may result in more pronounced phenolic characteristics.

Beer Style: Some beer styles, such as Hefeweizens, are known for their prominent estery aromas, like banana and clove. Others, like certain Belgian ales, may intentionally feature both phenolic and estery notes.

Quality Control: Controlling fermentation conditions, yeast health, and pitching rates are essential for achieving consistent and desirable levels of phenolic and estery compounds in beer.

Ultimately, understanding and managing phenolic and estery characteristics are fundamental skills for brewers who aim to produce high-quality beer with the desired flavor and aroma profiles. Achieving the right balance is crucial for creating beers that meet the expectations of a particular style or customer preference.

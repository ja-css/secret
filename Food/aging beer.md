The quality or the flavor characteristics of your brew will continue to improve up to 2-3 months 
mark once bottled.
People talk about 8-10 week mark as optimal time or optimal flavor point.
From there the flavor qualities will stabilize up to 10-12 months mark.
After that the flavor qualities or the characteristics will start to diminish, and 
you will experience what you might describe as stale beer.

https://www.liquidimageco.com/what-is-the-difference-in-saf-instant-yeast
The two types of Safale yeast—red and gold—have some distinct differences beyond 
the obvious visual distinction. Red SAF yeast, also known as brewer’s yeast, 
is better used for bottom fermenting lager beers.
It has low attenuation and ferments at a colder temperature compared to other 
yeast strains, with a fermentation temperature range between 10 and 15°C (50 to 59°F).
This yeast produces a smooth, clean flavor with hints of maltiness 
and low fruity esters.

On the other hand, gold SAF yeast, also known as “ale yeast,” is better suited to 
top fermenting. It generally has higher attenuation and ferments at a slightly 
higher temperature than red SAF yeast—between 15 and 22°C (59 to 72°F).
This yeast produces a richer and more complex flavor, with slightly spicy 
characteristics and medium to high levels of fruity esters like banana and bubblegum.

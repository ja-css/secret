# Uninterruptible Power Supply UPS HAT For Raspberry Pi Zero

Buy on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JZH16WH/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=AIVH4OZ6D0Y4K&psc=1

This Uninterruptable Power Supply HAT (UPS HAT) for the  [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2 "Raspberry Pi Zero 2")  (or any Zero  **with pins soldered on**) comes with a 1,000mAh Li-Po battery and incorporates a Li-Po battery switching charger with path management, a voltage boost chip and a voltage/current monitor which allows monitoring the battery operating status via the I2C bus!

**Note: Your Pi Zero must have a GPIO pin header soldered on - otherwise the PoGo Pins won't reach!**

Without other devices/hardware connected, and when in standby mode, the battery can feed the  _original Pi Zero WH_  for approximately 6-7 hours after fully charging******.

Convenient 'Pogo Pins' are used to connect the HAT to the underside of your Pi Zero WH, leaving the GPIO header free for pHATs and other hardware. A handy LED recharging indicator lets you know what status your battery is in, whilst the onboard power switch allows you to control power in a quick and convenient way.

**Uninterruptable Power**

The HAT is able to recharge the battery and provide power output to your Pi Zero WH at the same time from an  [external power supply](https://thepihut.com/products/official-raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply). It automatically switches over to battery power if the external power supply is unavailable, keeping your project running without any break in power.

**Real-time Monitoring**

Monitor the battery voltage, current, power and remaining capacity via I2C!

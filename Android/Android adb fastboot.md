## Back to stock android: here

## Option 2 (using factory images): If you flashed your device with the factory image after unlocking the bootloader, after a successful boot into Android 13 for the first time  
  
- Extract the contents of the factory ROM .zip file, identify the bootloader image in the extracted files, and follow the sequence of events as listed below to flash the bootloader to both the slots. Substitute the name of the bootloader image with that of your device for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6a.  
  
- Start the device in fastboot mode with one of the following methods:  
  
- Using the adb tool: With the device powered on, execute:  
  
```  
adb reboot bootloader  
```  
  
Using a key combo: Turn the device off, then turn it on and immediately hold down the relevant key combination for your device.  
  
- Flash the Android 13 bootloader to the inactive slot. The following command is specific to a particular build of a Pixel 6 Pro device. Substitute the name of the bootloader image determined in the first step above, if different, for the image file name argument.  
  
`fastboot` should be run as root  
  
Unlock flashing  
```  
fastboot flashing unlock  
```  
Flash bootloader  
```  
fastboot --slot=other flash bootloader bootloader-raven-slider-1.2-8739948.img  
```  
  
**STOPPED HERE**  
      
If the flash was successful this command will print OKAY [ ... ]. Do not proceed unless this command completes successfully.  
  
- After flashing the inactive slot bootloader to an Android 13 bootloader, reboot to that slot to ensure that the bootloader will be marked as bootable. Important: Please run the exact sequence of commands as listed below. Don't forget to enter the full line fastboot reboot bootloader when rebooting. Failure to do so may leave your device in an unbootable state.  
```  
    fastboot set_active other  
    fastboot reboot bootloader  
    fastboot set_active other  
    fastboot reboot bootloader  
  
```  
  
Reboot into the current OS. Either press the power button to boot or use the following fastboot command:  
```  
	fastboot reboot  
```  
  
**CONTINUED HERE**  
      
  
## Here's the OS flash  
### Flashing instructions  
The factory image downloaded from this page includes a script that flashes the device, typically named flash-all.sh (On Windows systems, use flash-all.bat instead).  
  
lock the bootloader  
from fastboot  
  
```  
fastboot flashing lock  
```

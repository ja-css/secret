## RJ45 Ethernet Cable Pinout

Ethernet LAN cables can come in two types –  **Crossover or Straight**  through. Most modern communications equipment can auto-sense which type you are using, but some still need the correct cable pinout. The following are the pinouts for the  **RJ45 connectors**  so you can check which one you have or make up your own. It doesn’t matter if you make up some Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat7 cables. The pinout is always the same for Ethernet cables.

## Straight Through LAN Cable Pinout

Straight through LAN cables are the most common, and the pinout is the same if they are Cat5e, Cat6, or Cat 7. The different types of cables (category or cat) offer increasingly faster transmit and receive speeds. This is achieved by increasing the wire twists, better shielding, drain wire, and increased diameter.

There are two different pinout standards used worldwide, and depending on your location, you will determine which one you should use. An easy way to remember the two different RJ45 connector pinouts is T568A is used in America and Asia, and T568B is used in Britain(UK) and Europe. The different pinouts will still work if you mix them up.

-   T-568**A**  – Most commonly used in the US**A**  and  **Asia**  – Think A for America
-   T-568**B**  –  **B**ritain (UK) and Europe

### RJ45 Pinout for a LAN Cable

-   **Pin 1** → White and Green (Transmit +) wire
-   **Pin 2** → Green (Transmit -) wire
-   **Pin 3** → White and Orange (Receive +) wire
-   **Pin 4** → Blue wire
-   **Pin 5** → White and Blue wire
-   **Pin 6** → Orange (Receive -) wire
-   **Pin 7** → White and Brown wire
-   **Pin 8** → Brown wire

> Remember that Pin 1 is on the left hand side of the RJ45 connector with the clip at the rear.

## Crossover Ethernet Cable

Crossover Ethernet cables are used to connect two devices of the same type, for example, if you want to connect two routers or two PCs. Most modern IT equipment can auto-detect that a crossover needs to be made and change the signal. This is called  [MDI-X.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-dependent_interface#Auto_MDI-X)  A crossover LAN cable will connect the receive at one end to the transmit at the other. Care must be taken to clearly identify a crossover cable so it is not used by mistake, which may cause network outages. These cables are sometimes made with a cable that has a  **red outer sheath.**

-   **Pin 6** ← Orange wire → **Pin 2**
-   **Pin 7** ← White and Brown wire → **Pin 7**
-   **Pin 8** ← Brown wire → **Pin 8**

### How to Crimp an RJ45 Ethernet Cable

Follow these steps to make sure you make the perfectly crimped RJ45 connector:

1.  Trim the outer sheath back about 10mm to expose the inner conductors.
2.  Trim off any nylon strands or wire guides.
3.  Straighten the wires.
4.  Sort them out to the correct color codes for the pinout.
5.  Snip the wires so they are all the same length.
6.  Push the wires into the connector.
7.  Make sure the outer sheath is inside the RJ45 crimp.
8.  Crimp the connector.
9.  Test the Ethernet cable.

### What is the Maximum Length of an Ethernet Cable?

The recommended maximum length for any structured cabling is 100m. This includes 5m of patch cables at either end of the cable run, so the fixed cabling’s actual distance is 90m. Anything over this distance will introduce interference and losses on the cable, which will be seen as errors, dropped traffic packets, and reduced throughput.

> Structured Cabling = 90m
> 
> LAN Patch Cables = 2 x 5m

It’s good installation practice to keep the cable runs as short as possible and avoid unnecessary excessive cable service loops.

## What pins does Ethernet use?

An Ethernet cable RJ45 connector has 8 pins. Pins 1 & 2 (green) and pins 3 & 6 (orange) are used for data communications while pins 4 & 5 (blue) and pins 7 & 8 (brown) are not used.

## How many pins does Ethernet use in a RJ45 connector?

An Ethernet cables uses a RJ45 connector that has 8 pins. Pin 1 is on the left hand side while holding the connector with the tab facing away from you.

## What is the maximum length of an Ethernet cable?

The maximum length of any Ethernet cable (Cat 5, Cat 6 or Cat 7) is 100m or 328ft before any loss of traffic occurs. Over 100m the traffic will start to get errors and reduced speeds.

## What is a RJ45 connector?

A RG45 connector is commonly used on an Ethernet cable in computer networks. RG45 stands for Registered Jack No.45, has 8 pins and is crimped on to the cable.

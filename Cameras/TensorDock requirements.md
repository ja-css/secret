Requirements

We'd recommend a 
    gigabit connection, 
    16 GB of RAM per GPU, 
    PCIE 4.0 x8 / 3.0 x16 bandwidth per GPU, 
    and at least 8 CPU threads per GPU. 
    We'd also require at least 100 forwarded ports OR a dedicated IP, whichever works best for you.

Ultimately, this will be a marketplace for compute. 
People will pay less for a virtual machine with a GPU with inadequate bandwidth 
(e.g. PCIE 3.0 x4) than a GPU with adequate bandwidth 
(e.g. PCIE 3.0 x16), as they'd be able to run more intensive workloads. 
The quality of your hardware will determine your earnings.

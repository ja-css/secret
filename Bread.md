## Stop Staling in its Tracks

If you live by yourself and there’s no way you’ll eat an entire loaf of bread before it goes bad, you can always freeze it. It doesn’t count if you put the bread in the fridge, either, as only freezing temperatures will push the pause button on the staling process.

Migoya suggests slicing your bread and freezing it in stacks of four or six. Whenever you want to eat it, pull it out and heat it up—in a toaster, an oven, or a pan—for a couple of minutes, and it’ll be delicious once again.

## It’s Alive!

Yes, you can bring your bread back to life. No, it won’t require a defibrillator or putting your loaf under the faucet as you may have seen on the internet. Migoya says “it’s a little absurd to do that,” since all the water you need is already in the bread.

Instead, wrap the bread in aluminum foil and put it in an oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (170 degrees Celsius). Heat the bread until the core temperature of the loaf reaches 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius). You’ll need a probe thermometer for this, which you can set to alert you when the bread is ready.

“The starch will reabsorb the water at this point, and when you pull it out of the oven, it will be like you have a brand new loaf of bread,” Migoya says.

## Didn’t Freeze it, Didn’t Revive it. Now What?

If you have a baguette or other type of lean bread—meaning it doesn’t contain fat—croutons are always a good idea. Slice the bread, then coat it in olive oil, salt, and pepper. If you want to add a little more flavor, add minced garlic and oregano. Put the bread in a toaster oven until it’s nice and crunchy. Break it up and voilà: croutons.

- Croutons made from lean breads are crunchier than they are crispy, and if you use sourdough bread, those crumbly little cubes will keep their crunch for even longer when mixed into a salad or soup. You might want to skip croutons made out of spongy bread, such as brioche—they tend to absorb liquid quickly and turn soggy, and no one likes that in their salad.

Once you have croutons, Migoya recommends making [Panzanella](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Summer-Panzanella/). A summer favorite, this Italian salad is a tasty, but simple, mix of croutons over diced tomatoes and fresh basil.

- Bread pudding is one of the most delicious ways to save your stale bread from the trash. You can [make it sweet](https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/bread-pudding-with-caramel-sauce/) and eat it as a dessert, or you can [make it savory](https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Sweet-Potato-Bread-Pudding/) and serve it as a main dish.

For a sweet version of bread pudding, Migoya recommends letting the bread soak in a custard (heavy cream or milk, eggs, and sugar). Breads like challah, brioche, or sandwich bread are great for this type of recipe because their spongy texture makes them super absorbant.“They can mop up the liquid a lot better, so to me, they produce a better bread pudding,” Migoya says. “And the older the bread, the more [it] is going to absorb.”

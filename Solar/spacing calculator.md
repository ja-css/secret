# Solar Panel Orientation
https://solarific.co/us/ak/anchorage

Orientation
Your photovoltaic panels need to be angled facing south.

Fixed tilt
If you're mounting the photovoltaic panels at a stationary angle, such as on your roof, 
the most efficient angle is 56.3°.

2-Season tilt
If you're planning to change the angle of your photovoltaic panels twice per year, 
the most efficient angle is 35.9° in summer months and 72.7° in winter months.

4-Season tilt
When changing the angle of your photovoltaic panels each season, 
the most efficient angle is 32° in summer months and 78.4° in winter months, 
and 57.6° in autumn and spring months.



# Solar Panel Azimuth


Nikiski, AK, USA
Your optimal azimuth angle is true south, which is:
14.2° east of magnetic south
